## 2025-07-30 - Initial Planning Reorganization
**Type**: Reorganization
**Components**: Both
**Impact**: Improved planning clarity and tracking

Created hierarchical planning structure:
- Separated samrena and datazoo planning into dedicated directories
- Added master plan for high-level coordination
- Created adjustments directory for tracking plan changes
- Established changelog for planning history

Previous flat structure made it difficult to track adjustments and dependencies. New structure provides:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better adjustment tracking
- Easier cross-referencing
- Historical context for decisions
