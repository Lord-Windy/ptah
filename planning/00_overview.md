# Datazoo Improvement Plan Overview

This directory contains bite-sized tasks for improving the datazoo hash map library. Each task is designed to be self-contained and implementable independently, though some have dependencies on earlier tasks.

## Task Order and Dependencies

### Phase 1: Quick Fixes (Can be done immediately)
- **01_fix_header_guards.md** - Simple rename, no dependencies
- **02_mandatory_samrena.md** - API clarification, no dependencies
- **11_const_correctness.md** - API improvement, no dependencies

### Phase 2: Core Improvements (Should be done in order)
- **03_key_copying.md** - Critical safety feature, required for correctness
- **04_dynamic_resizing.md** - Performance improvement, depends on key copying
- **08_error_handling.md** - Robustness, should be done with above changes

### Phase 2.5: Essential Samrena Improvements (High priority, can be done in parallel)
- **13_automatic_expansion.md** - Add configurable arena expansion policies
- **14_reset_functionality.md** - Add arena reset/clear capability

### Phase 3: New Features (Can be done after Phase 2)
- **05_clear_operation.md** - New API, depends on basic structure
- **06_iterator_implementation.md** - New feature, depends on stable structure
- **07_bulk_operations.md** - Performance feature, depends on resize logic

### Phase 3.5: Additional Samrena Features (Can be done after Phase 2.5)
- **15_custom_alignment.md** - Support custom alignment requirements
- **16_save_restore_points.md** - Enable temporary allocation patterns
- **17_memory_statistics.md** - Add optional memory usage tracking
- **18_bulk_operations.md** - Optimize array allocation patterns

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional)
- **09_type_safe_macros.md** - Optional enhancement, can be done anytime

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance (Do after implementation)
- **10_comprehensive_testing.md** - Should be done incrementally with each feature
- **12_documentation.md** - Final step after all features are stable

### Phase 6: Advanced Documentation and Customization (Final phase)
- **19_thread_safety_documentation.md** - Document concurrency behavior
- **20_custom_allocators.md** - Support alternative memory sources

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with Phase 1 tasks for immediate improvements
2. Implement Phase 2 in order for core functionality
3. Add Phase 3 features as needed
4. Consider Phase 4 if type safety is important
5. Continuously update tests and documentation

## Notes
- Each task includes verification steps
- All memory allocation must use samrena
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document all breaking changes
