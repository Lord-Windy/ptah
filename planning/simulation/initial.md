# Space Simulation Planning Framework

## The Vision

Picture a vast, breathing universe where every asteroid tumbles through
space according to the laws of physics, where sprawling space stations
emerge from the ambitions of competing factions, and where the economy
pulses like a living organism through trade routes that players and AI
actors carve across the void. This is a universe that continues to evolve
even when no one is watching, where diplomatic tensions simmer between
colonies light-years apart, and where the infrastructure you build today
becomes the foundation for tomorrow's conflicts or alliances.

The simulation operates on a heartbeat—a tick system that drives
everything from orbital mechanics to market fluctuations. Each tick
represents a moment where thousands of calculations cascade through the
system: ships adjust their trajectories, factories consume resources and
produce goods, diplomatic messages traverse the void, and procedural
algorithms spawn new opportunities or threats at the edges of known space.

## Core Philosophical Pillars

### The Living Universe

The world should feel alive and consequential. Every action ripples
outward—a new mining operation affects local prices, which influences
trade routes, which shifts the balance of power between factions. The
simulation continues whether players are present or not, creating a sense
of a world that exists beyond any single observer's experience.

### Emergent Complexity from Simple Rules

Rather than scripting specific outcomes, we create systems that interact
in unexpected ways. The economy isn't just numbers in a spreadsheet; it's
cargo holds being filled, fuel being burned, and decisions being made by
countless actors pursuing their own goals. Diplomacy emerges from resource
scarcity, territorial disputes, and the accumulation of countless small
interactions.

### Performance Through Parallelization

The compute shader approach isn't just a technical choice—it's
a philosophical one. By embracing massive parallelization, we can simulate
physics for millions of objects, calculate economic transactions across
thousands of markets, and process the decision-making of countless AI
actors, all in real-time.

## System Architecture Overview

### The Tick Engine

At the heart of everything lies the tick system—a metronomic pulse that
drives the simulation forward. Consider the tick not as a simple timer,
but as a conductor orchestrating a complex symphony of systems:

- **Tick Rate Considerations**: Do we run at 10Hz for responsiveness or
  1Hz for computational efficiency? Perhaps a hybrid approach with
  different systems operating at different frequencies?
- **Tick Budgeting**: Each subsystem gets a time slice to complete its
  work
- **Determinism Requirements**: Critical for multiplayer synchronization
  and replay systems
- **Tick Interpolation**: Smooth representation of state changes between
  ticks

### Physics and Geometry Foundation

The spatial reality of your universe begins here. Without graphics, the
physics engine becomes pure mathematics—a ballet of vectors and forces
played out in memory:

- **Spatial Partitioning Strategy**: Octrees for 3D space division,
  enabling efficient collision detection and proximity queries
- **Orbital Mechanics**: N-body simulation for realistic celestial
  mechanics, or patched conics for performance?
- **Collision Resolution**: Elastic collisions for asteroids, damage
  modeling for ships
- **Scale Management**: From meters to astronomical units—how do we
  maintain precision across scales?

### Economic Simulation Layer

The economy breathes life into the cold vacuum of space. Resources flow
like blood through the arteries of trade routes:

- **Resource Types**: Raw materials, refined goods, energy, information,
  human capital
- **Market Mechanics**: Supply/demand curves, price discovery, market
  inefficiencies that create opportunities
- **Production Chains**: Complex manufacturing dependencies creating
  strategic bottlenecks
- **Economic Actors**: Traders, manufacturers, pirates, regulators—each
  with different behavioral models

### Social and Diplomatic Framework

Between the silent orbits and bustling markets, relationships form and
fracture:

- **Reputation Systems**: Multi-dimensional tracking of standing between
  actors
- **Communication Protocols**: How information propagates through
  space—speed of light delays?
- **Treaty Mechanics**: Trade agreements, non-aggression pacts, defensive
  alliances
- **Cultural Evolution**: Procedurally generated belief systems that
  influence behavior

### Procedural Generation Engine

The universe should surprise even its creator. Procedural systems ensure
infinite variety:

- **Stellar Geography**: Star systems, asteroid fields, nebulae—each with
  unique characteristics
- **Faction Generation**: Procedural histories, motivations, and starting
  conditions
- **Event Systems**: Crises, opportunities, and discoveries that emerge
  from system states
- **Technology Trees**: Branching research paths discovered through
  exploration and experimentation

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Compute Shader Architecture

The GPU becomes not just a renderer but a massive parallel processor for
simulation logic:

```
Compute Shader Pipeline:
├── Physics Kernel: Position/velocity integration
├── Collision Kernel: Broad and narrow phase detection
├── Economic Kernel: Market clearing, price updates
├── AI Decision Kernel: Parallel actor decision-making
└── Procedural Kernel: Content generation passes
```

Consider the data layout carefully—structure of arrays (SoA) often
performs better than array of structures (AoS) on GPUs. Every byte of
memory bandwidth matters when simulating millions of entities.

### Persistence Layer

The universe must remember. Even when the servers sleep, the state of
existence must be preserved:

- **State Serialization**: Efficient formats for saving world state
  (consider columnar storage)
- **Delta Compression**: Store only changes between ticks for efficient
  replay/rollback
- **Sharding Strategy**: Spatial or logical division of the universe for
  distributed storage
- **Hot/Cold Storage**: Active sectors in memory, dormant regions on disk

### Actor Interface System

Players and AI need windows into this universe—portals through which they
can observe and influence:

- **Command Queue Architecture**: Actions submitted, validated, and
  executed on tick boundaries
- **View Projection**: What each actor can perceive based on position and
  capabilities
- **API Design**: RESTful? GraphQL? Custom binary protocol for
  performance?
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Who can control what in this
  persistent world

  relationships?
- **Networking Protocol**: TCP for reliability? UDP for performance? QUIC
  for both?
- **Compute Platform**: CUDA, OpenCL, Vulkan Compute, or DirectCompute?

### Design Philosophy Questions

- **Realism vs. Gameplay**: How accurate should physics be? Economic
  models?
- **Player Agency**: How much can a single actor influence the universe?
- **Time Scaling**: Real-time? Accelerated? User-controllable?
- **Failure States**: Can actors permanently fail? Is there permadeath?

### Technical Constraints

- **Memory Budget**: How much RAM can we assume? How much GPU memory?
- **Network Bandwidth**: What's acceptable for actor connections?

## Development Practices

### Testing Strategies

Testing an invisible universe requires creative approaches:

- **Deterministic Replay Testing**: Same inputs should always produce same
  outputs
- **Statistical Verification**: Economic metrics should follow expected
  distributions

- **Memory Profiling**: Track allocation patterns and cache efficiency
- **GPU Utilization**: Ensure compute shaders are actually faster
- **Network Metrics**: Latency, bandwidth, packet loss tolerance

### Documentation Philosophy
Document the why, not just the what:

## The First Steps

Tomorrow, begin with a single spinning asteroid in empty space, its
position updated sixty times per second by a simple tick loop. Add another
asteroid, then another, until thousands dance through the void. Watch as
collision detection struggles, then rejoice as compute shaders accelerate
the calculation a hundredfold.

Next week, that asteroid will have an owner. The week after, a price.
Within a month, it will be fought over by competing factions whose
relationships were forged through a thousand small interactions you never
explicitly programmed.

This is how universes are born—not with a big bang, but with a simple
tick, tick, tick...
