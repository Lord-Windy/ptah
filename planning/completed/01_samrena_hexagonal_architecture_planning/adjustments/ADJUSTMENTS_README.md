# Samrena Planning Adjustments

This directory contains all adjustments made to the samrena expansion plan. Each adjustment is tracked in a separate file for clarity and historical context.

## Naming Convention
Files should be named: `YY_brief_description.md`
- `YY`: Two-digit sequential number
- `brief_description`: Short, descriptive name using underscores

Example: `01_virtual_memory_priority.md`

## Creating New Adjustments
1. Copy the [ADJUSTMENT_TEMPLATE.md](../../ADJUSTMENT_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Create a new file with the next sequential number
3. Fill out all sections
4. Update the planning changelog
