# Task 19: Thread Safety Documentation

## Objective
Clearly document thread safety characteristics and provide guidance for multi-threaded usage.

## Current State
- No documentation about thread safety
- Unclear if arenas can be shared between threads
- No guidance on concurrent usage patterns

## Implementation Steps
1. Add thread safety section to header documentation:
   ```c
   /**
    * THREAD SAFETY:
    * - Samrena instances are NOT thread-safe
    * - Multiple threads must not access the same arena simultaneously
    * - Each thread should have its own arena instance
    * - Sharing allocated memory between threads is safe after allocation
    */
   ```

2. Document recommended patterns:
   - Per-thread arenas
   - Main thread allocation with read-only access from workers
   - External synchronization if sharing is required

3. Consider adding thread-safe variant (optional):
   ```c
   #ifdef SAMRENA_THREAD_SAFE
   // Mutex-protected versions of functions
   #endif
   ```

4. Add examples in documentation:
   - Worker thread pattern
   - Producer-consumer with arena
   - Avoiding data races

## Key Considerations
- Current implementation is not thread-safe
- Adding synchronization would impact performance
- Most use cases benefit from per-thread arenas
- Document clearly to avoid misuse

## Documentation Sections
1. Thread safety guarantees
2. Recommended usage patterns
3. Performance implications
4. Common pitfalls to avoid

## Verification
- Review all functions for thread safety implications
- Test concurrent access reveals issues (should fail)
- Verify documentation matches implementation
- Test recommended patterns work correctly
