What I need to do:

## Postgres

- Login
- Get all stock codes
- get start/end dates for codes
- Get data for a given stock code/exchange for a time range

## Nostradamus Algorithm

I need an algorithm to benchmark against, this will be called the
Nostradamus Algorithm that will run to see the theoretical maximum gains
that could be achieved on a stock.

- Take a collection of OHCLV data for a stock over a given range of dates
- Find the local minimum and maximums to buy/sell 
- Allow for regular selling and short selling 
- Configurable with settings to help determine best benchmarking

## Benchmarking Output

Create a system that will show for given stocks (and eventually other
things) how they compare against algorithms and decision making.

Not for this one, but I would like it to ouput typst
